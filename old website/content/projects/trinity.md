## Part 3: Face Blurring/Pixelating App
!TEMPLATE!
<div style="text-align: justify">
    A streamlit app for face blurring/pixelating of photos uploaded by the user. The user can upload multiple images and all the processed images can be downloaded as a zipped file. For face detection, the following deep learning models were used:
    <ul>
        <li>DSFD: Dual Shot Face Detector</li>
        <li>RetinaFace: Single-stage Dense Face Localisation in the Wild</li>
    </ul>
    This app is a simplification of the actual work of blurring/pixelating videos due to computational constraints.
