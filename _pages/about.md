Ph.D. Student at the [Silverman Lab](https://jsilve24.github.io/SilvermanLab/) in the College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Justin Silverman](http://www.justin-silverman.com/). My research focuses on developing fast and interpretable Bayesian time series models for microbial and financial data. Additionally, I am exploring conditional generative models, their applications in conformal prediction, and their statistical properties.

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [Tummee.com](https://www.tummee.com/), focusing on end-to-end software development and user experience optimization. Before that, I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) under [Dr. Ciaran Simms](https://www.tcd.ie/mecheng/staff/csimms/), [Dr. Aljosa Smolic](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/about-us/people-finder/profile/?pid=5280) and [Dr. Richard Blythman](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/richard-blythman-64b2b948), where I developed deep learning models and automated pipelines for predictive analytics and sports injury prevention.

I hold a master's degree in Informatics (Data Science) from [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/) and a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (formerly Delhi College of Engineering) in India.
