I am an incoming Ph.D. Student at the [Silverman Lab](https://jsilve24.github.io/SilvermanLab/) in College of Information Sciences and Technology at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Justin Silverman](http://www.justin-silverman.com/). I am interested in building robust and explainable deep learning models using bayesian non-parameteric and semi-parameterics. 

Previously, I was a software engineer at [Tummee.com](https://www.tummee.com/) from 2021-22 and as a Machine Learning Engineer at [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/) under [Dr. Ciaran Simms](https://www.tcd.ie/mecheng/staff/csimms/), [Dr. Aljosa Smolic](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-university-of-applied-sciences-and-arts/about-us/people-finder/profile/?pid=5280) and [Dr. Richard Blythman](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/richard-blythman-64b2b948).

Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I earned my master's in Informatics (Data Science) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://ist.psu.edu/) and bachelor's in software engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/) (erstwhile Delhi College of Engineering) in India.
