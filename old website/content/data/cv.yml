      description:
        - "Advisor: Prof. Justin Silverman"
        - Developed scalable Bayesian inference for a class of time-series models used to represent longitudinal multinomial data.
        - Validated our approach with application to understanding the factors and patterns in microbiota variation in the humangut.
        - Used matrix calculus to calculate closed-form gradients of the model for parameter estimation leading to optimizer converging 1.5x faster than automatic differentiation in Stan.
        - Generated 95% Credible Intervals of the estimated parameter using Bayesian Bootstrap.
        - Created a high-performance C++ header library for parallelized Metropolis probability distribution sampler with an R interface that is 32x faster than base R.
